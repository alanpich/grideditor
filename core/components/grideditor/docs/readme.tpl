GridEditor provides a fully-configurable grid view for displaying 
and editing resources in the manager interface. Any resource field 
or TV can be displayed and edited through the grid, with options 
for filtering and searching results built in.

A demo deployment is created on package install. This consists of 
a menu item 'My First GridEditor' and a demo configuration chunk 
'grideditor.config.demo'. These aim to demonstrate basic usage of 
the component for creating custom views.
